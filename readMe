- A minimum spanning tree is a subgraph of a tree that connects all of the tree's vertices
using the smallest amount of edges (for unweighted) or the lowest combination of edge
costs (for weighted), while also creating no cycles.

- The preconditions for Prim's algorithm are that the graph is weighted and connected, as
well as having no negative edge weights. Before Prim's algorithm you also have to choose
a starting vertex, have all the vertices initialized, and have a priority queue or something
similar ready.

- For Prim's algorithm, input is represented as the graph G = (V, E) where V is the set of
vertices and E is the set of edges, and output is represented as the minimum spanning tree
T = (V, E') where E' is the minimum total weight of the set of edges V. Input is a graph
with weighted connected edges and output is the mst of that graph.

- Some real world applications of Minimum Spanning Trees are GPS for the shortest route of
travel from A to B, online shopping graphs of customer purchases to find what the shortest
or closest thing they would be interested in, in power line distribution to find the most
optimal way to minimize the length of power lines, and in urban planning to design roads,
bicycle paths, and pedestrian walkways.
